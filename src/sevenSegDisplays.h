  * @brief	: Header file for SevenSegDisplays library classes
  *
  * @details This library builds Seven Segments LEDs displays independently from the hardware involved to execute the display. The included attributes and methods are hardware implementation agnostic, the hardware used might be changed by design requirements, and several different hardware display models might be used at the same time with the same API even if they are based on different driver chips or management technologies.

  ******************************************************************************
  * @attention	This library was developed as part of the refactoring process for an industrial machines security enforcement and control (hardware & firmware update). As such every class included complies **AT LEAST** with the provision of the attributes and methods to make the hardware & firmware replacement transparent to the controlled machines. Generic use attribute and methods were added to extend the usability to other projects and application environments, but no fitness nor completeness of those are given but for the intended refactoring project.
  * **Use this library is under your own responsibility**
